# Simple Form - Bootstrap 4

This gem configures simple form to support bootstrap 4. (currently beta)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'simple_form_bootstrap4', github: 'thiesp/simple-form-bootstrap4'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

Either add it to your Gemfile or generate the initializer into your project.

**Results may be unexpected if both the initializer is generated and the gem is included in you Gemfile.**

## Generate initializer

If you want to customize the initializer:

    $ rails g simple_form_bootstrap4:initializer

and remove the gem from your Gemfile.
